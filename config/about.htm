<h1>NavTable v##VERSION##</h1>

<p>
<b>NavTable </b> </div> is a <a href="http://www.gvsig.org"> gvSIG's extension</a> to view in a agile way the records of vectorial geographical information layers. Its main characteristic is that allows to see the element's attributes one by one and in vertical direction. Some of its features are: edit alphanumeric values and navigate among the elements of an information layer.
