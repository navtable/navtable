Introduction
===============

This document covers the description of:

* Version information.

* Build instructions.

* Packaging instructions.

* Internationalization notes.


Version information
============================

The version number is specified in the file "install/intall.xml" 
on the tag: <appversion> 0.6 </ AppVersion> 

It should also be changed in the file "config/about.htm" in tag: 
<h2> NavTable Extension v0.6 </h2> 

Build instructions
===============================

The code is compatible with the 1.5 JVM. 
Setting up a workspace to version 1.9 of gvSIG and then include this project into that workspace. 

Packaging instructions
===============================

To run it from the workspace can be launched build.xml to generate the necessary packaging within _fwAndami. 

To build an installer packaged with this plugin you can run the ant file "install/buildExt.xml."

To create a new tag we will have to do a Team/tags and use as tag name:

NavTable_[MAJOR]_[MINOR]_[MICRO]

Internationalization notes
===================================

* Where you can find the translation strings. 

Translation strings are inside the files "text_*.properties", where * is the ISO 639-1 language code, 
in the "config". The languages that are currently translated NavTable are:

+------------+--------------------+
| *Language* | *ISO 639-1 code*   |
+------------+--------------------+
| Spanish    | es		          |
+------------+--------------------+
| Galician   | gl	              |
+------------+--------------------+
| English    | en	              |
+------------+--------------------+
| French     | fr	              |
+------------+--------------------+
| Portuguese | pt	              |
+------------+--------------------+
| Italian    | it	              |
+------------+--------------------+
| German     | de	              |
+------------+--------------------+

* What should I do to include a new language

To add a new language, create a file, with the keys of one that already exists, with the language name 
followed by an underscore and the ISO 639-1 language code followed by the extension ".properties" 

Ex: For Galician: "text_gl.properties"
